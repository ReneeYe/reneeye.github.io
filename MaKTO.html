    Achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires AI agents that can not only make stratigic decisions but also engage in flexible and meaningful communication. Inspired by Wittgenstein's language game theory in <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, we propose that language agents can learn through in-context interaction rather than traditional multi-stage frameworks that separate decision-making from language expression. Using <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Werewolf</a></i>, a social deduction game that tests language understanding, strategic interaction, and adaptability, we develop <b>Multi-agent Kahneman & Tversky's Optimization (MaKTO)</b>. <b>MaKTO</b> engages diverse models in extensive gameplay to generate unpaired desirable and unacceptable responses, then employs KTO to refine the model's decision-making process. In 9-player Werewolf games, MaKTO achieves a <b>61%</b> average win rate across various models, outperforming GPT-4o and two-stage RL agents by relative improvements of <b>23.0%</b> and <b>10.9%</b>, respectively.
    Notably, MaKTO also demonstrates human-like performance, winning <b>60%</b> against expert players and showing only <b>49% detectability</b> in Turing-style blind tests. These results showcase MaKTO's superior decision-making, strategic adaptation, and natural language generation in complex social deduction games.

        <em>I am but a humble villager. I must admit, I slept rather soundly last night and was unaware of which legendary guard and esteemed witch joined forces to maintain peace in our village. Of course, we can't rule out the possibility that the werewolves chose not to attack anyone. However, these matters are no longer of great importance. What's crucial is that today, Player 4 has claimed to be the Seer and declared Player 9 as "golden" (confirmed innocent). Their statement was brief and lacked perspective, suggesting they could either be the true Seer or a werewolf who had no assigned task during the night. I need to base my decision on Player9's upcoming statement. If Player 9's words resonate well with me, I might side with Player 4.

If I were a werewolf impersonating the Seer, it would have been more impactful to accuse a player in the back positions of being a werewolf. Since there's a Guard in this game, if the Witch used her healing potion last night, both the Witch and the Guard should refrain from revealing their identities for now. The Guard should protect me tonight, and the Witch can choose to poison a player she suspects to be a werewolf. If the Witch didn't use her healing potion last night, both the Witch and the Guard can come forward to clarify their positions. In this case, the Guard can protect the Witch at night, while the Witch can either save a player who's been attacked by werewolves or poison a player who seems suspicious.</em></p>

		<em>I am a Villager. I choose to side with Player 4.

This statement comes from a werewolf's perspective. A real Seer would never suspect themselves of being a werewolf, nor would they hypothesize about being a werewolf impersonating the Seer. This kind of logic is something only a werewolf would consider. Therefore, I believe Player 7 is most likely a werewolf boldly claiming to be the Seer, while Player 4 is probably the real Seer.Player 8 has claimed to be the Witch, and so far, no one else has contested this role. I believe Player 8 is likely the real Witch. Player 4's statement was too brief, so I can't determine their true identity yet - they could be either the Seer or a werewolf.This round, if no other player claims to be the Seer later, I will vote for Player 7.</em></p>

		<em>I am the Guard. Last night, I didn't protect anyone. I believe Player 7 is the Seer, and Player 4 is a werewolf boldly impersonating the Seer. In the front positions, Players 4 and 7 both claimed to be the Seer. Player 4 declared Player 9 in the back positions as "golden" (confirmed innocent), while Player 7 declared the adjacent Player 8 as "golden". Player 4's verification seems more impactful than Player 7's at first glance, but since Player 4 was the first to speak, their brevity is understandable. So, analyzing just the statements of these two Seer claimants, it's difficult to determine who the real Seer is. However, Player 9's statement supporting Player 4 and attacking Player 7 is not well-founded. Player 9 is attacking Player 7 as a werewolf based on mere fragments of speech, which makes me think Player 9 is more likely a werewolf who knows Player 7 is the real Seer and is forcefully attacking them. In contrast, Player 8, after being declared "golden" by Player 7, claimed to be the Witch and sincerely analyzed the pros and cons of both Seer claimants without immediately siding with Player 7, who gave them 'silver' status. I believe Player 8 is more likely to be the real Witch. If no player in the back positions claims to be the Witch, I will side with Player 7 and vote for Player 4.</em></p>

		<em>Fellow players, I am an ordinary villager. After careful listening and consideration in this complex situation, I have decided to state my position. I firmly believe that Player 7 is the Seer. From the beginning of this round, Player 7's statements have exuded a sense of calmness and confidence. Their initial assessment of the situation was clear and logical, providing information that wasn't baseless speculation. When explaining their verification results, Player 7 spoke earnestly with unwavering eyes, conveying a sense of sincerity. Compared to some other players who were evasive or ambiguous, Player 7's performance aligns more closely with my expectation of how a true Seer should behave. Although I don't have a special role to verify this, I'm basing my judgment on intuition and observation of all players' behaviors. I also urge other villagers not to be misled by surface appearances. Join me in supporting Player 7. Let's work together in this game of truth and deception to find the werewolves hiding among us, protect our village, and maintain a peaceful and harmonious gaming environment. Player 9's statement is utterly ridiculous. How could Player 4 possibly be impersonating the Seer with just a few words? As the most astute villager here, I cannot be fooled by Player 4. The werewolf positions are likely Player 4 and Player 9, with Player 9 being the "flanking wolf" (a werewolf strategically supporting a fake Seer claim). This round, I will side with Player 7 as the Seer and vote to eliminate Player 4 as a werewolf. I suggest that the Witch use their poison on Player 9, the other suspected werewolf, during the night.</em></p>

		<em>I am a villager. Player 7 declared Player 8 in the back positions as "golden"(confirmed innocent), and Player 8 subsequently claimed to be the Witch. As of now, Player 8 is the only one claiming to be the Witch in the game. Therefore, I believe Player 7's statement carries significant weight, and their speech was appropriate without any logical flaws. In contrast, Player 4's statement was very brief and lacked the depth of thought one would expect from a Seer. Thus, I don't believe Player 4 is the real Seer. I am siding with Player 7 and suggest that the Seer verify Player 9's identity. This round, I will vote to eliminate Player 4. </em></p>

You can't claim to be the Witch and support your werewolf teammate - it breaks the game's basic rules! So 8 is lying.I think 7 and 8 are both werewolves.

		<em>Player 5's statement is utterly ridiculous, laughable to the extreme, and downright absurd! I can't fathom how Player 4 could possibly be the Seer with just those few words.
